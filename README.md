Media targeting: Use propensity algorithm to target the consumer via i-media. <br />
	Use the historical consumer shopping behavior and their demo to predict the SKU they want to buy. <br />
	According to the base-line model use bayesian-optimization to do the hyper-parameters tuning, and finally get XX percent accuracy.<br />
	And targeted more than 1,00,000 customer via i-media. +15% purchase rate vs. tradition behavior tag targeting.<br /> <br />
Media CIA Test and Control: Use algorithm to sample control group for media advertising result checking. <br />
	Sampled 2 million device ID as the control group in a 200 million device ID pool. And keep the control group sharing similar distribution with the test group in age, gender, city and installed app etc..<br />
	Deployed the algorithm in PG’s DMP, make the ROI score card more reasonable and stable. <br />
